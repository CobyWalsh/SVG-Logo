# SVG-Logo

## Discription

In this project I created a SVG logo using prompting questions in my command line. In my command line the user is prompted with four questions. The first question asks the user to choose no more than three characters for their logo, then the user is prompted to pick what color they want their characters to be using a color keyword or a hexadecimal number. Then the user is prompted to with three choices of shapes including a circle, square or a triangle. After the user chooses a shape they are asked what color they would like the shape to be using a color keyword or a hexadecimal number. Once the user answers all four of the prompted questions an logo.svg file is generated with the users logo they created. I also used Jest to run unit tests on my code.
